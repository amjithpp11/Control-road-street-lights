# Control-road-street-lights

Here is a basic outline for an algorithm that could be used to control road street lights:

1)Initialize the system by setting all street lights to the "red" state.

2)Monitor the traffic at the intersection using sensors or other means.

3)When the traffic on the main road reaches a certain threshold (e.g. a certain number of cars or a certain amount of time has passed since the last green light), change   the main road's street lights to "green" and the side road's street lights to "red".

4)After a set amount of time has passed (e.g. 30 seconds), change the main road's street lights to "yellow" to warn drivers that the light is about to turn red.

5)After a shorter set amount of time has passed (e.g. 5 seconds), change the main road's street lights back to "red" and the side road's street lights to "green".

6)Repeat steps 2-5 indefinitely to continually control the flow of traffic at the intersection.
